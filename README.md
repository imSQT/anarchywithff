# anarchywithff

these are two modules and anarchy file with experimental ff vote starting at 15 and going off at 3 minute intervals

NOTE: this does not work as it will spam /ff in conjunction to other functions for the duration of the minute.
will type e/ff. /eff. etc. until the timer goes past 15,18, ...
